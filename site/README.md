HTML5-canvas-matrix-digital-rain
================================

Animated matrix digital rain theme, made using the HTML5 canvas element and plain javascript.
Simulates the "digital rain" visual effects from the movie The Matrix.

A working example can be executed by opening index.html in a supported browser.
Tested and confirmed to be working in Google Chrome/Chromium 30, Firefox 25.
Should work in up to date major browsers, and IE9+.

In order to use the script for yourself, check out the existing index.html file.
The mandatory components are:
-matrix.js (or matrix.min.js)
-a canvas element with id of "DigiRain"
and that's it. Though for best results, it's a good idea to include the (minimal) CSS provided.


For a pure javascript alternative (ie. for browsers that don't implement the HTML5 canvas element properly/at all), check out my previous html/js matrix script, jQuery Matrix Digital Rain: https://github.com/koroshiya/jquery-matrix-digital-rain
*Note: contrary to the title, my previous script does not require jquery (anymore).
